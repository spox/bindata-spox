* Think how offset_of should work.

    + perhaps #offset_of and #abs_offset_of methods?
    + needed for struct and array

* Add ability to determine name of a data object.
    e.g.  obj.a[4].c

  This will be used when throwing exceptions to aid debugging.

* Using the above names, add tracing capability when reading.

* Clean up Array to make it as close to ruby Array as possible.

* Need more examples.

* Refactor test cases.
    add more comprehensive integration tests to serve as examples

* Need better documentation.
